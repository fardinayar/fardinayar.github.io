# Under Development
I am a Research Associate specializing in artificial intelligence, computer vision, and autonomous vehicles. Currently working at the Autonomous and Intelligence Systems Lab at Amirkabir University of Technology.

My research interests include:
- (3D) Rotbot Perception
- Vision Language Models
- Neural Implicit Representation
- 3D Reconstruction
- Graph Neural Networks

I hold an M.Sc in Artificial Intelligence and Robotics from Amirkabir University of Technology, where I graduated with distinction (18.75/20). My master's thesis focused on "Panoptic Segmentation using LiDAR and Camera for Autonomous Vehicles."

My technical expertise spans:
- Programming: Python, Java, C++
- Deep Learning Frameworks: PyTorch, TensorFlow, Detectron2, StableBaseline3
- Computer Vision and Autonomous Systems
- LiDAR and Sensor Fusion

I am a Research Associate specializing in artificial intelligence, computer vision, and autonomous vehicles. Currently working at the Autonomous and Intelligence Systems Lab at Amirkabir University of Technology, where I focus on cutting-edge research in autonomous driving, deep learning, and computer vision.

My research interests include:
- Cross-view Generalization for Large-Scale Neural Radiance Fields
- LiDAR Region Proposal For Instance Segmentation
- Open-set Scene Graph Generation with Vision-Language Models
- Monocular Depth Estimation
- Graph Neural Networks

I hold an M.Sc in Artificial Intelligence and Robotics from Amirkabir University of Technology, where I graduated with distinction (18.75/20). My master's thesis focused on "Panoptic Segmentation using LiDAR and Camera for Autonomous Vehicles."

I have published several papers in prestigious venues, including Computer Vision and Image Understanding and ICEA2024, where I received the Best Paper Award (Bronze) for my work on LiDAR-Camera Fusion for Video Panoptic Segmentation.

My technical expertise spans:
- Programming: Python, Java, C++
- Deep Learning Frameworks: PyTorch, TensorFlow, Detectron2, StableBaseline3
- Computer Vision and Autonomous Systems
- LiDAR and Sensor Fusion

I am fluent in both Farsi (native) and English, and I'm passionate about advancing the field of artificial intelligence and its applications in autonomous systems.
